# Uptime — self-hosted open-source uptime monitor in Node.js

A free, MIT-licensed, **self-hosted uptime monitor** written in Node.js. One Express + EJS app, SQLite (or MySQL), no Docker required (Docker is available if you want it). Built as a simple alternative to Uptime Kuma, Healthchecks.io, Gatus, Statping, and Better Stack.

**Monitor anything**: HTTP/HTTPS endpoints, TCP ports, ICMP ping, DNS records, TLS certificate expiry, **domain WHOIS / RDAP expiry** (catch a forgotten registrar renewal _before_ the domain falls off the internet), **passive heartbeats** for cron jobs and background workers (Healthchecks.io-style with `start`/`success`/`fail` pings, exit codes, cron schedules).

**Notify everywhere**: Discord, Slack, Telegram, Ntfy.sh, Gotify, Pushover, Mattermost, Microsoft Teams, generic webhooks, SMTP email — with fully customizable per-event templates and `{{placeholders}}`.

**Operate at team scale**: public **status page** (90-day strip + Atom RSS feed), token-authenticated REST API, **Prometheus `/metrics` exporter** for Grafana, maintenance windows (cron + one-off), tags and bulk actions, JSON backup / restore, audit log, rate-limited login, **TOTP 2FA per user**, **multi-user with per-monitor ACLs** (admin / editor / viewer + view / manage grants), and configurable data retention.

If you want a **lightweight self-hosted Uptime Kuma alternative** that you can `git clone && npm install && npm start` on any small VPS, this is for you.

## Screenshots

**Live dashboard** — compact monitor cards, animated state stripes, live polling every 5s, dark mode by default, full-text search, server-side pagination (50 per page) with **unhealthy monitors sorted first** so 1000-monitor instances still surface real issues on page 1, cert-expiry pill on HTTPS monitors, hover-to-delete inline action.

![Self-hosted uptime monitor dashboard with monitor cards and dark mode](docs/screenshots/dashboard.png)

**Filter, search, organise** — filter by state (up / down / unknown / paused), monitor type (HTTP / heartbeat / TCP / ping / DNS / cert / domain), Cloudflare mode, and coloured tags. Every URL parameter is preserved through pagination and bulk actions.

![Uptime monitor dashboard filters by state, type, Cloudflare mode and tag](docs/screenshots/dashboard-filters.png)

**Bulk actions** — toggle select mode, click cards to multi-select, then **pause / resume / delete / add tag / remove tag** from a sticky bottom action bar.

![Bulk pause, resume, delete and tag actions across many monitors](docs/screenshots/dashboard-bulk-actions.png)

**Add a monitor** — HTTP / TCP / ping / DNS / cert / domain / heartbeat in one form. Status / body-string / JSON-path / regex assertions, optional response-time threshold, per-monitor failure threshold, double-verify retry on failure, Cloudflare-aware mode, custom headers, tags, channels, and (for admins) per-monitor ownership.

![New monitor form with assertions, headers, tags and channel selection](docs/screenshots/monitor-form.png)

**Advanced probe options** — request body (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE with `text` / `json` / `form` types), Basic-auth or Bearer-token authentication, follow-redirects toggle, skip-TLS-verify for self-signed origins, notes, and notification mute.

![Advanced HTTP monitor options: auth, body, redirects, TLS verify, notes](docs/screenshots/monitor-form-advanced.png)

**Monitor detail** — 24h / 7d / 30d uptime %, P95 / min / max / avg response times, **interactive response-time chart** (Chart.js with 24h / 7d / 30d ranges), recent checks log, incident timeline, heartbeat ping log, and (when present) per-monitor sharing.

![Monitor detail page with response-time chart, uptime stats, and incidents](docs/screenshots/monitor-detail.png)

**Per-monitor sharing & incidents** — owners and admins can grant other users `view` or `manage` access on a per-monitor basis. Incident history shows duration, last error, and a `during_maintenance` flag when applicable.

![Per-monitor sharing grants with view / manage permissions and incident history](docs/screenshots/monitor-detail-sharing.png)

**Notification channels** — 10 channel types (Discord, Slack, Telegram, Ntfy, Gotify, Pushover, Mattermost, MS Teams, email, generic webhook). Attach any combination to any monitor.

![Notification channels list: Discord, Slack, Telegram, Ntfy, Gotify, Pushover, Mattermost, Teams, email, webhook](docs/screenshots/channels.png)

**Customizable templates** — every event (DOWN / RECOVERED / CHALLENGED / CERT_EXPIRING / DOMAIN_EXPIRING / TEST) has its own title and body with `{{placeholders}}` like `{{site_name}}`, `{{site_url}}`, `{{error}}`, `{{status_code}}`, `{{duration_human}}`, `{{cert_days_remaining}}`, `{{domain}}`, `{{domain_days_remaining}}`, `{{domain_registrar}}`. Click a placeholder to insert it at the cursor, click "reset to default" to start over.

![Notification message templates with placeholder palette](docs/screenshots/channel-templates.png)

**Backup & restore** — export all (or a selected subset of) monitors, channels, and SMTP settings to a portable JSON file. Restore it on another instance with a configurable conflict strategy (skip / replace / rename). Live preview shows what's in the file before you commit.

![Backup and restore configuration: JSON import / export with conflict strategy](docs/screenshots/backup-restore.png)

**Public status page** — unauthenticated `/status` route with 90-day daily uptime bars, current state badges, last-24h MTTR, and a `/status.rss` Atom feed. Group monitors into ordered named buckets, override display names per group, hide internal-only monitors with one flag.

![Public status page with 90-day uptime bars and grouped monitors](docs/screenshots/status-page.png)

**Multi-user with roles** — flat `admin` / `editor` / `viewer` roles. Admins create users, reset passwords, disable 2FA, and delete accounts; the `.env` super-admin stays as a permanent break-glass account.

![Admin users and roles management with role badges, 2FA status, last login](docs/screenshots/settings-users.png)

**Per-monitor ACL grants** — pick a user, then set `none` / `view` / `manage` on every monitor with bulk "all view" / "all manage" / "reset" buttons.

![Per-user, per-monitor access control grants: none, view, manage](docs/screenshots/settings-user-grants.png)

**My account** — every logged-in user manages their own profile, password, **TOTP 2FA** (QR enrolment + 10 single-use recovery codes), and **personal API tokens** from one page.

![Personal account page: profile, password, 2FA, recovery codes, API tokens](docs/screenshots/settings-account.png)

**Audit log** — every state-changing action is recorded with actor (username or `env`), IP, action, target, and structured JSON `meta`. Non-admins only see their own rows.

**TL;DR** — Uptime Kuma is the obvious comparison. This project picks a different trade-off: fewer notification channels, but **first-class multi-user ACLs**, **Cloudflare-aware probing**, **a built-in Prometheus exporter**, **a real audit log**, and a **single-process, Docker-optional** deployment. If you run on a small VPS behind nginx and want something that looks and feels like Uptime Kuma but with proper team support, this is built for that.

## Features

### Monitor types
- **HTTP / HTTPS** — configurable interval, timeout, method, per-monitor request headers.
- **TCP** — raw `net.Socket` connect to host:port with optional banner-substring assertion.
- **Ping (ICMP)** — shells out to the system `ping` (no `CAP_NET_RAW` needed unless containerised); reports avg RTT and partial-loss as failure.
- **DNS** — A / AAAA / CNAME / MX / TXT / NS / SRV / CAA / SOA / PTR via `dns.promises.Resolver` with optional custom resolver and substring / `/regex/` expected-value match.
- **Certificate** — TLS-handshake-only monitor, works for non-443 ports (SMTPS, IMAPS, custom). Tracks days-remaining and fires `cert_expiring` at a per-monitor threshold (default 14 days).
- **Domain (WHOIS / RDAP expiry)** — track the registration expiry of the domain itself, not the TLS cert. The probe tries [RDAP](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7480) first using the IANA RDAP bootstrap registry (structured JSON, parsed reliably) and falls back to WHOIS over TCP/43 with multi-pattern parsing for diverse registry formats. Stores `expires_at`, `registrar`, EPP `status`, and `days_remaining`. Fires `domain_expiring` at a per-monitor warn-band (default 30 days), with anti-spam bands at 30 / 14 / 7 / 3 / 1 / 0 days so you don't get nagged hourly. Lookups run at most every 12h (server-clamped) and gracefully report `unknown` for redacted / public-suffix domains instead of false-flagging them DOWN. Input is normalised — paste `https://www.example.com/path` and it stores `example.com`.
- **Passive heartbeat (Healthchecks.io-style)** — each monitor has a unique token with four endpoints: `/ping/<token>`, `/ping/<token>/start`, `/ping/<token>/0`, `/ping/<token>/<non-zero>`. Bodies up to 4 KB are captured; exit code and duration are computed across `start`/`success` pairs. Schedules can be **interval+grace** _or_ **cron** in a chosen timezone.

### Assertions (HTTP monitors)
- **Status code** — single (`200`) or comma list (`200,204,301`).
- **Body contains string** — case-sensitive substring match against the auto-decompressed response body.
- **JSON path equals value** — dot-path lookup like `data.status` or `items[0].ok` on the parsed JSON body.
- **Body matches regex** — `pattern` (default `i`) or `/pattern/flags`.
- **Response-time threshold** — flips a passing response to DOWN if it exceeds `max_response_time_ms`.

### Probe controls (per monitor)
- **Failure threshold (anti-flap)** — fire DOWN only after N consecutive failed checks. Default `1`.
- **Double-verify on failure (per monitor)** — opt-in safety net. When a check fails, retry exactly once 2 seconds later. Only if the retry *also* fails does the failure count toward `failure_threshold`. Applies to every active probe type (HTTP / TCP / ping / DNS / cert / domain). Catches transient drops — DNS hiccups, packet loss, upstream blips, Cloudflare flapping — without delaying real DOWN alerts the way a longer interval would.
- **Request body** — POST / PUT / PATCH / DELETE with `text` / `json` / `form` type — Content-Type set automatically.
- **Authentication** — first-class Basic auth (username / password) or Bearer token.
- **Follow redirects** — 0 or up to 5 hops (`undici` `maxRedirections`).
- **Skip TLS verify** — opt-in `rejectUnauthorized: false` agent for self-signed origins.
- **Mute notifications** — keep probing, suppress channel dispatches (distinct from "pause").
- **Pause / resume** any monitor without losing history.
- **"Check now"** button for instant manual probes.

### Cloudflare-aware probing
- Rotated realistic browser User-Agents and headers (so probes don't look like a bot).
- Automatic Brotli / gzip / deflate response decompression — assertions actually see the decoded body.
- Cloudflare challenge detection (status, `cf-mitigated` header, body markers) → recorded as **inconclusive** (not counted against uptime, no false-positive alerts).
- Optional per-monitor "Cloudflare mode": HEAD-first probe (status checks only), 60s minimum interval, adaptive exponential backoff on consecutive challenges (cap 30 min), one-shot "being challenged" notice after 5 in a row.
- ±5% interval jitter on every monitor so checks don't pile up on the wall clock.

### Notifications
- **Multi-channel fan-out** — attach any number of channels per monitor. Each channel is independently configured.
- **10 channel types**: Discord (rich embeds), Slack, Telegram, Ntfy.sh, Gotify, Pushover, Mattermost, Microsoft Teams (adaptive cards), Email (SMTP), Generic webhook.
- **Custom message templates per event** — DOWN / RECOVERED / CHALLENGED / CERT_EXPIRING / DOMAIN_EXPIRING / TEST each have their own title and body with `{{placeholders}}` like `{{site_name}}`, `{{site_url}}`, `{{error}}`, `{{status_code}}`, `{{duration_human}}`, `{{cert_days_remaining}}`, `{{domain}}`, `{{domain_days_remaining}}`, `{{domain_expires_at}}`, `{{domain_registrar}}`, `{{timestamp}}`. One-click reset-to-default per template.
- **Maintenance windows** suppress alerts globally or per monitor on a cron schedule or one-off range — events still log as `suppressed_by_maintenance`.
- **Test send** button on every channel for instant verification.
- `APP_DEBUG=true` switches every channel into dry-run mode — the would-be payload is logged instead of sent.

### Dashboard & UI
- Tabler-themed dashboard, **dark mode by default** with one-click light/dark toggle.
- Compact monitor cards with status stripe, animated dot, 24h uptime %, last response time, last-checked relative time, **tag chips**, cert-expiry pill on HTTPS monitors, domain-expiry pill on `domain` monitors. **50 per page** with server-side pagination, **unhealthy monitors sorted first** (down → unknown → up → paused) so the worst issues always land on page 1 — comfortably handles 1000+ monitors without UI lag.
- **Filter & search bar**: by name/URL, by state (up/down/unknown/paused), by monitor type, by Cloudflare mode, by tag.
- **Bulk actions** — toggle select-mode for per-card checkboxes + a sticky bottom bar to pause / resume / delete / add-tag / remove-tag in one shot.
- **Live updating** — the dashboard polls only the visible monitors every 5s and updates state, response time, and last-checked in place.
- **Per-monitor detail page** with 24h / 7d / 30d uptime %, P95 / min / max response times, response-time chart (Chart.js, 24h / 7d / 30d ranges), recent checks log, incident timeline, heartbeat ping log, and notes block.
- **Active maintenance banner** whenever any window is currently silencing alerts.
- **Delete from listing** — hover any card to reveal an inline trash button with a confirm modal.
- Mobile-responsive — action buttons stack, badges wrap, tested on small screens.

### Public status page
- Unauthenticated **`/status`** route plus **`/status.rss`** Atom feed.
- Ordered named groups with per-monitor display-name override and an "exclude from status page" flag.
- 90-day daily uptime bar per monitor, current state, last 24h MTTR.
- Optional token gate via `STATUS_PAGE_PUBLIC=false` + `STATUS_PAGE_TOKEN`.

### Incident tracking
- Each DOWN → UP transition records an incident with start / end timestamp, duration, and last error message.
- `during_maintenance` flag set on incidents opened inside a window.
- Per-monitor incident table on the detail page (last 25, "ongoing" badge for active incidents).
- **CSV exports** at `/sites/:id/checks.csv`, `/sites/:id/incidents.csv`, and `/incidents.csv` (filtered by ACL for non-admins).

### Tags & organisation
- Coloured tags with inline rename / recolour from a 12-colour Tabler palette.
- Filter the dashboard by tag, add / remove tags on monitors in bulk, multi-select on the monitor form.

### Multi-user with per-monitor ACLs
- **Three flat roles**: `admin`, `editor`, `viewer` — managed at `/settings/users`.
- **Per-monitor grants** layered on top: `view` (read access) or `manage` (read + write). Owners and admins can hand out grants from each monitor's Sharing card; admins can also manage them in bulk from `/settings/users/:id/grants`.
- **Default visibility is strict** — non-admins see only monitors they own or were granted. Admins see everything.
- **`.env` super-admin** stays as a permanent break-glass account, always admin, with its own independent TOTP secret. DB users get their own per-user TOTP.
- **Argon2 password hashing** (`argon2` package).
- **Forced password change** flag set on every freshly-created user.
- **Disable** a user with one click — the next request invalidates their session.
- **Personal API tokens** — every user mints their own tokens from `/settings/account` and tokens inherit the creator's ACL.
- **Claim-unowned button** — new DB admin can take ownership of legacy monitors with one click.

### REST API & metrics
- Bearer-token authenticated REST under `/api/v1/` with `read` / `write` scopes (admins create them at `/settings/api-tokens`; users mint personal ones at `/settings/account`). **Full CRUD for monitors via JSON** — `POST /api/v1/sites` creates monitors of any of the 7 types, `PATCH /api/v1/sites/:id` does partial updates, `DELETE /api/v1/sites/:id` removes them, plus the existing pause / resume / check-now write actions. Strict per-type validation, ACL inheritance, owner-only ownership reassignment.
- Endpoints: `health`, `sites`, `sites/:id`, `sites/:id/checks`, `sites/:id/incidents`, `incidents`, `tags` (GET + POST/PATCH/DELETE), `stats`, plus `pause` / `resume` / `check-now` / `DELETE` on a site.
- Every `/api/v1` response is filtered through the token owner's ACL, so non-admins can only see / act on monitors they have access to.
- **Prometheus exporter** at `/metrics` — series for `uptime_monitor_up`, `uptime_monitor_response_time_ms`, `uptime_monitor_last_check_age_seconds`, `uptime_monitor_uptime_pct_24h`, `uptime_cert_days_remaining`, `uptime_domain_days_remaining` (registered-domain WHOIS / RDAP expiry, emitted for `domain` monitors), `uptime_monitors_total{state}`, `uptime_open_incidents`. Public until the first API token is created; token-gated thereafter and ACL-filtered.
- Tokens stored as SHA-256 with last-used timestamp tracked; the plaintext token is shown exactly once at creation.

### Settings
- **SMTP settings panel** with "Send test email" and "Verify connection". Password never re-displayed.
- **Backup & restore (JSON import / export)** — export all or a selected subset of monitors, channels, and SMTP settings to a portable JSON file. Restore with conflict strategy (skip / replace / rename) and selective per-section import. Live preview shows what's in the file before you commit.
- **Maintenance windows** UI — CRUD, toggle, timezone-aware cron (`cron-parser`) or one-off.
- **API tokens** UI — create / revoke with cURL + Prometheus scrape examples.
- **Users & roles** UI — admin-only, with per-user grants management.
- **My account** UI — profile, password, personal 2FA, personal API tokens.
- **Audit log** UI at `/settings/audit` with action-filter dropdown and JSON meta inline.
- **Whitelabeling** via env vars: custom app name, tagline, logo, favicon, footer text/link, or hide the credit line entirely.

### Security
- Session-based login + optional **TOTP 2FA per user** (RFC 6238, native `crypto`, 10 single-use recovery codes). The `.env` super-admin keeps its own 2FA secret independently.
- **Argon2id** password hashing for all DB users.
- **Multi-user with per-monitor ACLs** — `admin` / `editor` / `viewer` roles + per-monitor `view` / `manage` grants enforced on **every read, write, API, CSV, and Prometheus endpoint**.
- **Login rate-limit & lockout** — 5 failures / 15 min per IP, 10 failures / 30 min per username; a successful login clears both buckets.
- **Audit log** persists login / 2fa / user / api_token / site / tag events with `actor` (username or `env`), `actor_user_id`, IP, and structured `meta`. Non-admins see only their own rows.
- **CSRF-safe POST forms** — every form is same-origin and session-scoped.
- `</script>`-safe JSON serialization for inline `<script>` flash payloads.
- All `:id` route params validated up front (non-numeric IDs return a clean 404 instead of a stack trace).
- Open-redirect-safe `returnTo` after login (only same-origin paths accepted).
- Reverse-proxy aware (`trust proxy`, real client IP from `CF-Connecting-IP` when used).

### Operations
- **SQLite by default** (zero setup, ships idempotent schema) — or **MySQL** by setting `DB_DRIVER=mysql`.
- Schema is applied on boot (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS …`) with idempotent column-add migrations — no manual migration step. Tested against both drivers on every release.
- **Configurable retention** — `CHECKS_RETENTION_DAYS` (90), `INCIDENTS_RETENTION_DAYS` (365), `HEARTBEAT_PINGS_RETENTION_DAYS` (30), `AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` (180). Daily prune + optional SQLite `VACUUM`.
- Structured logs via `pino`, console + daily-rolling file (`logs/app.log`, 14-day retention, configurable via `APP_DEBUG`).
- Built-in PM2 ecosystem file. Boots cleanly behind nginx / Caddy / Cloudflare.
- **Optional Docker** — multi-stage `Dockerfile` (slim Debian, runs as `node` user) + `docker-compose.yml` with SQLite-by-default and a `mysql` profile for an opt-in MySQL sidecar. Built-in `/healthz` endpoint for container healthchecks.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codewizdevs/uptime.git
cd uptime
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env (at minimum: SESSION_SECRET, ADMIN_USER, ADMIN_PASS)
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 and sign in with the admin credentials you set in `.env`.

That's it — SQLite is the default, no database server required. The schema auto-applies on first boot.

To enable multi-user mode after first launch, sign in with the env admin, go to **Settings → Users & roles**, click **New user**, and start handing out per-monitor grants.

---

## Configuration

All configuration lives in `.env`. The most important keys:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `3000` | HTTP port the app listens on |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | _(unset)_ | **Required.** 32+ random characters used to sign session cookies. Generate with `openssl rand -hex 48`. |
| `ADMIN_USER` / `ADMIN_PASS` | `admin` / `admin` | Env super-admin login (permanent break-glass account). Change before exposing publicly. |
| `APP_DEBUG` | `false` | `true` enables trace logging **and** dry-runs all notification channels (payloads logged instead of sent). |
| `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:$PORT` | Public URL used to render heartbeat ping URLs in the UI. |
| `DB_DRIVER` | `sqlite` | `sqlite` or `mysql`. |
| `SQLITE_PATH` | `data/uptime.sqlite` | SQLite file path (relative to project root or absolute). |
| `DB_HOST` / `DB_PORT` / `DB_USER` / `DB_PASSWORD` / `DB_NAME` | — | MySQL connection (only when `DB_DRIVER=mysql`). |

### Whitelabeling

Whitelabeling is managed live from **Settings → Branding & whitelabel** in the app — app name, tagline, logo, favicon, footer credits, and credit-line visibility, all without a restart. Logo and favicon uploads are stored in the database; the URL versions bust browser cache automatically on update.

Older deployments that set `APP_NAME`, `APP_TAGLINE`, `APP_LOGO_PATH`, `APP_FAVICON_PATH`, or `FOOTER_CREDITS_*` in `.env` still work as a fallback when the database value is empty, but the panel is the primary path going forward.

A complete list with comments is in [`.env.example`](./.env.example).

## Heartbeat monitors (passive / cron monitoring)

Heartbeat monitors cover cron jobs, background workers, batch ETLs, and internal services that aren't reachable from the outside. Create one in the dashboard, copy the unique ping URL, and have the service hit it on a schedule:

```bash
* * * * * curl -fsS https://your-monitor.example.com/ping/<token> > /dev/null
```

Wrap a long-running job to capture exit code and duration:

```bash
curl -fsS https://your-monitor.example.com/ping/<token>/start
backup_database.sh
curl -fsS https://your-monitor.example.com/ping/<token>/$?
```

If we go more than `interval_seconds + heartbeat_grace_seconds` without a ping (or past the next cron occurrence + grace), the monitor flips DOWN and your channels fire. Bodies up to 4 KB are captured per ping, the last 25 are shown on the detail page.

---

## Production deployment (PM2 + nginx)

The app ships with a PM2 ecosystem file and was designed to run behind nginx (or any reverse proxy).

```bash
# 1. Install
git clone https://github.com/codewizdevs/uptime.git /opt/uptime
cd /opt/uptime
npm install --omit=dev
cp .env.example .env  # edit it

# 2. Run under PM2
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start src/server.js --name uptime
pm2 save
pm2 startup            # run the printed command to enable boot persistence

# 3. nginx vhost (proxy 443 → 127.0.0.1:3000) — example below
```

A minimal nginx vhost looks like this:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name uptime.example.com;
    ssl_certificate     /etc/ssl/uptime/origin.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/uptime/origin.key;

    set_real_ip_from 0.0.0.0/0;
    real_ip_header CF-Connecting-IP;
    real_ip_recursive on;

    client_max_body_size 16m;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Host              $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP         $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
    }
}
```

If your edge is Cloudflare, set SSL/TLS mode to **Full** (a self-signed origin cert is fine) — origin terminates TLS, Cloudflare handles the public certificate.

---

## Run with Docker (optional)

Docker isn't required, but a multi-stage `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yml` are committed for users who prefer it.

```bash
cp .env.docker.example .env
# edit .env — at minimum change SESSION_SECRET and ADMIN_PASS

docker compose up -d                  # SQLite, data in the uptime-data volume
# or:
docker compose --profile mysql up -d  # also spin up a mysql:8.4 sidecar
```

The default profile ships only the `uptime` container with SQLite under a named volume. The `mysql` profile adds a `mysql:8.4` service alongside (set `DB_DRIVER=mysql` in `.env` to use it). The app container runs as the unprivileged `node` user, includes `tini` as PID 1, exposes port 3000, and has a built-in healthcheck against the unauthenticated `GET /healthz`.

For the ICMP `ping` monitor type inside the container, compose grants `NET_RAW` to the app service — drop that cap from `cap_add` if you don't need ping monitors.

---

## REST API quickstart

Create a token at `/settings/account → API tokens` (shown exactly once). Then:

```bash
TOKEN=utk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Read
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://uptime.example.com/api/v1/sites | jq
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://uptime.example.com/api/v1/sites/123 | jq

# Write
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -X POST https://uptime.example.com/api/v1/sites/123/check-now
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -X POST https://uptime.example.com/api/v1/sites/123/pause
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -X DELETE https://uptime.example.com/api/v1/sites/123
```

### Create monitors via API (all 7 types)

`POST /api/v1/sites` accepts a JSON body. The request shape mirrors the form fields, so anything you can build in the UI you can build via the API. Required scope: `write`. Required role: `admin` or `editor`. Returns **201** + the freshly-loaded site DTO.

```bash
# HTTP monitor with body-string assertion + custom headers + double-verify
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST https://uptime.example.com/api/v1/sites -d '{
    "name": "API",
    "monitor_type": "active",
    "url": "https://api.example.com/health",
    "method": "GET",
    "interval_seconds": 60,
    "timeout_ms": 5000,
    "check_type": "string",
    "expected_string": "\"ok\":true",
    "failure_threshold": 2,
    "double_verify": true,
    "request_headers": {"User-Agent":"uptime","X-Trace":"on"}
  }'

# TLS certificate expiry monitor
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST .../api/v1/sites -d '{"name":"API cert","monitor_type":"cert","cert_host":"api.example.com","cert_port":443,"cert_expiry_warn_days":30}'

# TCP socket monitor
curl -s -X POST .../api/v1/sites -d '{"name":"Redis","monitor_type":"tcp","tcp_host":"10.0.0.5","tcp_port":6379}'

# ICMP ping monitor
curl -s -X POST .../api/v1/sites -d '{"name":"Edge","monitor_type":"ping","ping_host":"1.1.1.1","ping_count":3}'

# DNS record monitor
curl -s -X POST .../api/v1/sites -d '{"name":"DNS A","monitor_type":"dns","dns_query":"example.com","dns_record_type":"A","dns_expected":"93.184.216.34"}'

# Domain WHOIS / RDAP expiry monitor
curl -s -X POST .../api/v1/sites -d '{"name":"example.com expiry","monitor_type":"domain","whois_domain":"example.com","domain_expiry_warn_days":30}'

# Passive heartbeat monitor (server auto-generates heartbeat_token in the response)
curl -s -X POST .../api/v1/sites -d '{"name":"Nightly job","monitor_type":"heartbeat","heartbeat_grace_seconds":300}'
```

### Partial updates

`PATCH /api/v1/sites/:id` merges the JSON body over the existing row, so you can flip one field without resending the entire monitor:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X PATCH .../api/v1/sites/123 -d '{"paused": true}'

curl -s -X PATCH .../api/v1/sites/123 -d '{"interval_seconds": 120, "failure_threshold": 3, "double_verify": true}'

# Re-bind notification channels (omit the field to leave channels untouched)
curl -s -X PATCH .../api/v1/sites/123 -d '{"channel_ids": [4, 7]}'
```

### Tags via API

`GET /api/v1/tags` lists tags (read scope). Create, update, and delete require **write** scope and **admin** role (same as Settings → Tags). `POST` is idempotent: creating an existing name returns **200** with the tag.

```bash
# List tags (read)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://uptime.example.com/api/v1/tags | jq

# Create tag (write + admin) — 201, or 200 if name already exists
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST https://uptime.example.com/api/v1/tags -d '{"name":"production","color":"green"}'

# Update tag
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X PATCH https://uptime.example.com/api/v1/tags/3 -d '{"color":"blue"}'

# Delete tag
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -X DELETE https://uptime.example.com/api/v1/tags/3
```

Validation is strict — unknown enum values, missing required fields per monitor type, and malformed `request_headers` all return **400 {"error","details":[…]}**. Tokens inherit the creator's ACL — a viewer's token can only read monitors they have access to, write actions require both the `write` scope **and** `manage` permission on the target monitor, and `POST /api/v1/sites` additionally requires `admin` or `editor` role. Tag write endpoints require **admin** role.

Scrape config for Prometheus:

```yaml
- job_name: uptime
  metrics_path: /metrics
  bearer_token: utk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  static_configs:
    - targets: ['uptime.example.com']
```

- **HTTP client (probes)**: `undici` with a shared keep-alive agent
- **DB**: SQLite (`better-sqlite3`) or MySQL (`mysql2/promise`) via a thin abstraction
- **Sessions**: `express-session` (memory store; swap to a persistent store if you cluster)
- **Passwords**: `argon2` (argon2id)
- **Mail**: `nodemailer`
- **Templating**: EJS
- **Frontend**: Tabler CSS (CDN) + vanilla JS (no Bootstrap JS bundle), Chart.js (CDN), Notyf for toasts
- **Logs**: `pino` + `pino-pretty` + `pino-roll` (daily rotation, 14-day retention)
- **No Docker required** — `node`, `npm`, optional `pm2` is all you need.

## Roadmap & welcomed PRs

A detailed phase-by-phase changelog of what's shipped lives in [`PLAN.md`](./PLAN.md) — phases 1–13 plus the post-v1 increments (Cloudflare-aware probing hardening, domain WHOIS/RDAP expiry tracking). Forward-looking ideas, all explicitly out of scope for v1 but on the table as opt-in plugins:

- [ ] Multi-region probe fleet (worker mode)
- [ ] On-call schedules and phone-call escalation
- [ ] Multiple assertions per monitor with AND/OR logic
- [ ] SAML / OIDC SSO
- [ ] Groups / teams (per-group ACLs on top of the existing per-monitor grants)
- [ ] More notification channels (PagerDuty, Opsgenie, Zulip, Matrix)
